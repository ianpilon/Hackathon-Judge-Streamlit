# Where We Left Off - January 23, 2025

## Current State

### Completed Features
1. Local Video Analysis App
   - Video frame analysis using CLIP
   - Audio transcription using Whisper
   - Fixed duplicate text in results display
   - Improved error handling for audio processing
   - Working GUI interface with PyQt6

2. Code Organization
   - Repository: https://github.com/ianpilon/Hackathon-Judge-Jan-23
   - Proper .gitignore for Python projects
   - Updated README with installation and usage instructions
   - Clean project structure

### Next Steps for Web Conversion

If continuing with web conversion, here's the proposed architecture:

1. Frontend (React + Vercel)
   - Next.js project structure ready
   - Upload component for videos
   - Results display component
   - TailwindCSS for styling

2. Backend Requirements (FastAPI)
   - Need separate hosting (not Vercel) due to:
     - Heavy CPU/GPU requirements for video processing
     - Longer processing times than serverless limits
     - Memory requirements for video handling
   - API endpoints for video upload and analysis
   - Temporary storage management for uploads

3. Deployment Considerations
   - Backend needs proper server hosting (DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP)
   - Environment variable management for API URLs
   - CORS configuration between frontend and backend
   - Docker configuration for backend deployment

## Sample Code Available

The last discussion included sample code for:
1. React frontend page structure
2. FastAPI backend setup
3. Dockerfile for backend deployment

These can serve as starting points when ready to proceed with web conversion.

## Current Limitations

1. Only runs locally due to:
   - GUI-based interface
   - Direct file system access
   - Resource-intensive processing

2. Requires local Python environment with:
   - PyQt6 for GUI
   - CLIP and Whisper models
   - Various video processing libraries

## Next Major Features to Consider

1. Web Interface
   - Convert to React-based frontend
   - Create RESTful API backend
   - Add progress indicators for long-running processes

2. Processing Optimizations
   - Parallel processing for video frames
   - Caching of analysis results
   - Stream processing for large videos

3. User Experience
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Better error messaging
   - Result downloading options
